**l_trunc**: Truncation length for legendre terms. Should be a positive integer. 

**depol**: Depolarization factor to use in Rayleigh calculations (unitless).

**architecture**: Hardware architecture to use for calculations. Should be one among [`CPU`, `GPU`].

## **geometry** group

**sza**: Solar zenith angle, units in `degrees`. 

**vza**: List of viewing zenith angles, units in `degrees`. 

**vaz**: List of viewing azimuthal angles, units in `degrees`. Should be same length as **vza**. 

**obs_alt**: Altitude of observer, in `Pascal`. 

## **atmospheric_profile** group

**T**: Temperature at each layer *midpoint*, as list from TOA to BOA, in `Kelvin`. 

**p**: Pressure at each layer *boundary*, as list from TOA to BOA, in `hPa`. Should be one element greater in length than T. 

**q** (optional): Specific humidity at each layer *midpoint*. Units in `g/Kg`. 

**profile_reduction**: Length of profile reduction to be performed internally. Must be positive integer less than length of T, *or* -1 for no reduction. 

## **absorption** group (optional)

**molecules**: Which molecules should be used for absorption calculations in each band. Should be a list of lists of molecule names (outer list over number of bands, inner list to hold molecules). Use `vSmartMOM.Absorption.show_molecules()` to see a list of valid molecules. 

**vmr**: A dictionary of volume-mixing ratios that match every individual molecule listed in **molecules** to a vmr. A vmr can be either a single number, or an array to interpolate from TOA to BOA, according to the number of layers specified by the p/T grids. 

**broadening_function**: Type of broadening function to use in absorption calculations. Should be one of [`Voigt()`, `Lorentz()`, `Doppler()`]. Please note the parentheses. 

**CEF**: Complex error function for Voigt calculations. Default should generally be used, `HumlicekWeidemann32SDErrorFunction()`. Please see Absorption/complex_error_functions.jl for details. 

**wing_cutoff**: Wing cutoff to use in the line-by-line absorption calculations. Should be a positive number in units, `cm⁻¹`. 

## **scattering** group (optional)

**aerosols**: A list of scattering aerosols and their properties. Each aerosol should be a dictionary of key-value pairs for the following keys: 
- **τ_ref**: Reference τ, in `µm`
- **μ**: Log mean radius, in `µm`
- **σ**: Log stddev of radius, in `µm`
- **nᵣ**: Real part of refractive index (unitless)
- **nᵢ**: Imaginary part of refractive index (unitless)
