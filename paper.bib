    abstract = {This paper describes the contents of the 2016 edition of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2012 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is composed of five major components: the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line form, collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption phenomena, added line-shape formalisms, and validity. Moreover, molecules, isotopologues, and perturbing gases have been added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Of considerable note, experimental IR cross-sections for almost 300 additional molecules important in different areas of atmospheric science have been added to the database. The compilation can be accessed through www.hitran.org. Most of the HITRAN data have now been cast into an underlying relational database structure that offers many advantages over the long-standing sequential text-based structure. The new structure empowers the user in many ways. It enables the incorporation of an extended set of fundamental parameters per transition, sophisticated line-shape formalisms, easy user-defined output formats, and very convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data. A powerful application programming interface making use of structured query language (SQL) features for higher-level applications of HITRAN is also provided.}

abstract = {We have analyzed the effect of aerosols on the retrieval of the dry air mixing ratio of carbon dioxide (XCO2) in the Earth's atmosphere from instruments like OCO-2 and GOSAT. High-fidelity simulations of multi-angle spectropolarimetric observations in the O2 A-band and the weak and strong CO2 bands are used to evaluate the information contained in different measurement subsets/synergies for the retrieval of aerosol, surface, and molecular parameters. We contrast the biases and uncertainties in the retrieved XCO2 resulting from the assumption of free or fixed aerosol microphysical parameters in the retrieval algorithm. It is very difficult to achieve the required retrieval accuracy of 0.2% for XCO2 using intensity-only Nadir mode measurements. The uncertainty in the retrieved XCO2 can be minimized by introducing multiangle and polarimetric measurement synergies. While the retrieval bias on XCO2 is practically eliminated by the addition of measurement synergies for free aerosol microphysical parameters, fixed aerosol retrievals can lead to an increase in XCO2 bias. In both cases, our full multi-angle polarimetric dataset produces a maximum uncertainty of ~1.6% in the retrieved XCO2 at low aerosol optical thicknesses and over dark surfaces. The XCO2 retrieval uncertainty improves to better than 0.2% at greater aerosol optical thickness and brighter surfaces. The problematic low aerosol optical thickness and low surface brightness regime produces an XCO2 bias of 1 − 8% for fixed aerosol microphysics, while the free parameters produce a maximum bias well under 10−3% for all retrieval scenes considered.}
